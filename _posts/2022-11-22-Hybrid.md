Hybrid work models have become mainstream in many world-renowned companies, allowing employees at all levels of the organisation to provide more flexibility and support by combining in-office and remote work. Many employees regularly change their office environment according to their needs. The shift in new paradigms is also bound to bring new changes and tensions, and the line between going to work and leaving work is becoming more and more blurred, implicitly extending working hours, and off-duty life is still disturbed by the online office software used by the organisation. Thus, companies must respond quickly to challenges and maintain employee productivity and morale in a dispersed team environment. After a deep analysis to the organisational factors of the successful hybrid model, exploring the rights and power of employees in the operation of such work model, and recommendations are given on balancing hybrid work models and employees' after-hours disconnect right.

### Key Organizational Factors Lead To the Successful Working Model
**Transformational Leadership shapes corporate culture**

Under a successful hybrid working model, employees are given more freedom to choose when to work and how to participate into work, and transformational leadership then become the key to the success. As more employees transition to working from home and companies look to shift to digital workspaces, managers will adapt to the new management context of hybrid work, including the shift from supervisory thinking to employee self-driven thinking instead of a top-down approach to driving decision-making (Gottardello,2022). Both employers and employees abide by the spirit of the enthusiasm to work and self-commitment. Employers fully trust employees allowing employees to arrange their own working hours and formal their own agendas. The action on giving employees more autonomy remark a shift in traditional leadership. Transformational and charismatic leadership could be applied by creating a workplace environment that prioritises employee growth and excellent performance (Gottardello, 2022).  Hybrid model success therefore depends on a new leadership model that inspires employees develop their own intrinsic motivation to work, who feel trusted and cared for to maximize their potential to achieve a higher level of performance.

Furthermore, well-functioned hybrid work is only possible if the organisation's culture climate is inclusive and supportive. The leadership transformation also promotes an influential corporate culture by embodying the purpose and authenticity, creating a mechanism of dissent, and creating a conversation about value (Ferreira et.al, 2021; Kuknor & Bhattacharya, 2020).  To achieve the success of the hybrid working model, organisations ensure that all employees have a consistent experience at work, including full participation and equal attention.  The diversity and inclusion on organisational culture can help businesses maintain transparency and drive innovative outcomes, it create a positive work environment and a thriving company culture where every employee feels valued and recognized (Jandrić, 2022; Mazur, 2014). Companies are starting to focus more on promoting mutual support at all levels to ensure that employees remain comfortable and integrated when disconnected from the traditional office environment or working online alone. For example, companies are more often bring their employees together for personal and professional development activities during and outside normal company hours. Leaders and front-line managers maintain continuous and good interaction and communication with employees under remote conditions. Employees are more likely to be satisfied with clear recognition what they are trying to achieve and the mission of the company. Therefore, transformational Leadership and corresponding- formed will lead to the success of hybrid work. 

**Close cooperation to stronger connections**

When employees have more flexibility on choosing working hours and locations, cooperation is extremely important and become the key to the success of hybrid working model. Communication misunderstandings are more likely to occur in a hybrid model, and cooperation and more teamwork ensure timely communication and a level of understanding between employees. Cooperation occurs based on an understanding of the environment - what are the goal of the team, the direction and trend of developments, and the interests of all parties (Potočnik, 2022). Working with distributed teams requires constant communication and collaboration, and employees are using office communication apps or business phones more frequently to ensure they can easily stay in touch with colleagues. Team member’s continuous share perception of policies, practices, and procedures concerning how the work should be done (Buchanan & Huczynski, 2019). Such high intensive teamwork drives transparency and fluidity in the team's communication and understanding of plans under hybrid working environment. 

On the other hand, Close cooperation and high-efficient teamwork also foster stronger connections between employee individual and their organizations.  Employees maintain wellbeing from stronger connections then become one of key factors to a successful hybrid working model. Whether it is due to reduced networking or career opportunities, new career considerations, and pandemic-related struggles, more and more people feel isolated, employees need to expand their social networking or career development without more concerns under the hybrid working model (Ferreira et.al, 2021). The close interaction created by more teamwork or cooperation facilitated employees create connections with organisations as much as possible to express their needs and maintain wellbeing. Once the employees' needs are detected, organisations respond to the demands of employee change, defining new productivity relationships more concretely, including collaboration, learning, and, most importantly, well-being and belonging (Fu & Deshpande, 2014). For example, a varieties of extracurricular activities and events such as online workshop, video games competitions designed by an organisation are critical to establishing a company's image as actions to care employee wellbeing and creating new bonds with its employees. Those unique bonds are forged by flexible working hours, where and how employees work. Thus, the key factor of the successful working model is that employees can get the same quality of development space and maintain high wellbeing potential by maintain strong connection to organisations. 

**Keywords related to Employee Right to Disconnect from Work**

Protecting employees' right to disconnect from work aims to balance their work and leisure and further increase their well-being. The article mentions the key to building a successful virtual workplace and hence increasing employees' well-being and belongings (Baker & Chan-Ahuja, 2022). However, the three keywords and corresponding adaptions may not be as effective as the article addressed and potentially harm the employee's right to disconnect from work. 

**Consistency**

Consistency between the way organisations and employees work is particularly important. The article argues that motivation often comes from employees rather than management or direct supervision, so skill matching and cultural fit will be looked at in recruitment (Baker & Chan-Ahuja, 2022). Under such circumstance, Job seekers need to proactively fit into the company culture to get a job. The existing cultural model and cultural tradition of the enterprise can provide employees with spontaneous or conscious value standards, and establish their own sense of identity with the corporate culture Buchanan & Huczynski, 2019). So, suppose the company culture is competitive and overly efficient, then the employees in the company are likely to voluntarily give up the right to disconnect from work just to fit in with the company culture or to be coerced by the company culture.

**Communication**

Regarding the discussion on “communication”, it is mentioned that the whole team meets online to discuss general business and weekly meetings planned for the week. Outside of these weekly meetings, employees rely heavily on their communication tools (Baker & Chan-Ahuja, 2022). The reliance on communication equipment may blur the boundaries between going to and from work. It may happen that employees are more likely to remain connected to communication devices even during off-hours and office habits that promote dialogue (Beňo, 2021). Informal chats are held where employees share other aspects of their lives and make more personal bonds as one of the social interactions. This feedback is undoubtedly positive. But this positive feedback further deepens the connection with communication equipment. It is difficult for employees to distinguish between life and work when using communication equipment, which is likely to cause employees to unconsciously give up the right to disconnect.

**Connection**

Furthermore, serval methods for establishing “connection” are mentioned in the article. Practices include dedicating an hour to social activities to make these connections, and leaders were spending time in weekly meetings discussing non-work topics, interacting with employees, and learning about what they are doing in life (Baker & Chan-Ahuja, 2022). Scheduling such linkage during the pandemic should be encouraged. However, setting special non-work topics in meetings and mandating social events on the calendar will likely impact employees' work schedules. The weekly meeting time is compressed because of the discussion of non-work topics or attending social events in the face of delays in work projects. For example, when an employee is about to face a project delivery, they cannot communicate with other teams at the start of the meeting immediately.  Employees are bound to delay their time off the job to complete a late track schedule or find time to continue meetings with the team on unfinished issues after the mandating social events. These follow-up actions caused by the projects delay will undoubtedly have an impact on the disjointed power of employees. 

### Recommendations 
**Policymaking** 

Establishing a transparent and specific right-to-disconnect policy would be a priority. Consult with employees to gain participation and support to develop a "right to disconnect" policy for departmental operations and processes. Also, organisations ensure that the organisation and employees understand and comply with their respective legal responsibilities, including the fact that employees can refuse to work or work-related activities after or outside normal business hours. Employers should respect their employees' right to disconnect (Pegoraro et al., 2020). There is a need to set clear boundaries between work and employees' autonomous lives by making clear daily working schedules and sharing policies among employees. 

Meanwhile, Policies should consider the issues that most multinational enterprises may face when implementing a hybrid work model, such as working on the same projects online across time zones. Organisations accommodate flexibility under the framework of justice to demonstrate the right of employees to long-term compensation for loss of disconnection rights in exceptional circumstances. The process of policy development will provide clarity and the feasibility of supporting implementation. Most importantly, Management should lead by example in implementing these policies and invite employees to monitor their implementation.

**Organisation Culture building**

In addition to establishing a clear disconnection right, organisations need to take a joint approach to create a new “informed” company culture where employees feel that disconnection from projects and any work-related devices is necessary and encouraged by the company. “Informed” means sharing the company's cultural principles in a way that allows employees to deduce how these principles should play out in different types of tasks and interactions (Potočnik, 2022; Fu & Deshpande, 2014).  More specifically, Companies can work with the technology department to record the number of time employees spend using office software and set up friendly reminders after exceeding the prescribed time. At the same time, post posters or other promotional messages encouraging employees to spend time with their families after work. Make employees aware of the need for work-life balance, thereby further consciously developing employees' power to disconnect.

**Set up a resolution team**

Establish a dedicated team from the HR department to handle hybrid work models. Its main functions include implementing and promoting the above recommendations, such as assisting the system and enforcing the company's policy on disconnection, actively promoting the company's corresponding cultural atmosphere, and dealing with any demands regarding the hybrid work model. This group aims to support employees to work from anywhere, anytime, to give employees a sense of belonging in this new work model (Potočnik, 2022).  The complexity of hybrid work and the uncertainty of the work environment make it even more important for employees to assist each other. Positive help-seeking behaviour helps employees improve their work performance and creativity and enhances their happiness (Potočnik, 2022; Guest, 2017). Employees know what to do and whom to ask for help when dealing with similar issues. Teams must provide and plan for online networking and other networking opportunities for employees to interact and connect online without affecting the right of others, including themselves, to disconnect. At the same time, the team also needs to work with the technical department to keep an eye on how satisfied employees are and how long they work and take corrective action in a timely manner according to the specific situation. 

### Discussion

In order to ensure the successful operation of the organisation, it is critical to provide employees with the environment of efficient cooperation and senses of belonging. A successful hybrid working models meet the organisations operation needs and respects rights of every individuals. Companies with a sense of social responsibility and a healthy organisational culture should proactively recognise the impact of new ways of working changing on the imbalance in the distribution of employees' time and provide effective support to protect employees' rights.
